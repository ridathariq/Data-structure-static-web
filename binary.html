            <pre class="pre">A Binary Search Tree is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. 
  Each node in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right child.The left child is containing values less than
  the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node.This hierarchical structure allows for efficient searching,
  insertion, and deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.</pre><br>

    <h2 class="h22">ALGORITHM FOR BINARY SEARCH TREE :</h2><br>
    <pre class="pre1">1. Insertion

        To insert a new key in a BST:

        1.Start from the root node.
        2.Compare the key to be inserted with the current node's key.
        3.If the key to be inserted is less than the current node's key, move to the left child.
        4.If the key to be inserted is greater than the current node's key, move to the right child.
        5.Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach an empty spot (null).
        6.Insert the new key at that empty spot.

2. Search

        To search for a key in a BST:

        1.Start from the root node.
        2.Compare the key to be searched with the current node's key.
        3.If the key is equal to the current node's key, the search is successful.
        4.If the key is less than the current node's key, move to the left child.
        5.If the key is greater than the current node's key, move to the right child.
        6.Repeat steps 2-5 until you find the key or reach an empty spot (null).

3. Deletion

        To delete a key from a BST:

        1.Start from the root node.
        2.Find the node to be deleted.
        3.If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove it.
        4.If the node to be deleted has only one child, replace it with its child.
        5. the node to be deleted has two children:
        6.Find the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree).
        7.Copy the inorder successor's value to the node to be deleted.
        8.Delete the inorder successor.

4.Traversals

        There are three common types of depth-first traversals:

        1.In-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, the root, and the right subtree.
        2.Pre-order traversal: Visit the root, the left subtree, and the right subtree.
        3.Post-order traversal: Visit the left subtree, the right subtree, and the root.
