<h2 class="h2">Basic terms used in trees</h2><br>

<dl>
    <dt class="dt"><b>Root:</b></dt>
 <dd  class="dd">The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent.</dd>
    <dt class="dt"><b>Child node:</b></dt>
    <dd class="dd">If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node.</dd> 
    <dt class="dt"><b>Parent:</b></dt>
    <dd class="dd">If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.</dd>
    <dt class="dt"><b>Sibling:</b>  </dt>
    <dd class="dd"> The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.</dd>
    <dt class="dt"><b>Leaf Node:</b></dt>
    <dd class="dd">The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called a leaf node.<br>
         A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree.
    <dt class="dt"> <b>Internal nodes:</b></dt> 
    <dd class="dd">A node has atleast one child node known as an internal</dd>
  <dt class="dt"><b>Ancestor node:</b></dt>
  <dd class="dd">An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any ancestors.</dd>
  <dt class="dt"><b>Descendant:</b></dt>
  <dd class="dd">The immediate successor of the given node is known as a descendant of a node.</dd>

<h2 class="h2">TYPES OF TREES</h2><br>
<h3 class="mid">Full Binary Trees</h3>
<img  class="img" src="full2.png" alt="full binary tree">
<ul class="ul"><li>A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.</li>
    <li>A full binary tree on the other hand does not have any nodes that have only one child node.</li>
    <li>If T be a nonempty full binary tree and has I internal nodes, the number of leaves is L = I + 1.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 class="mid">Complete Binary Trees</h3><br>
<img class="img" src="Complete.png" alt="complete binary tree"><br>
<ul class="ul"><li>Every level except possibly the lastis completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. </li>
<li>It can have between 1 and 2h nodes at the last level h.</li>
</ul>
